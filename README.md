# Advent of Code

Repository of my solutions of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
programming puzzles.

## Disclaimer
These solutions are only as good so I can call it a (solved) day. They're not a
showcase of my skills nor a good learning material. **I do this for fun and
joy**.

Christmas tend to be a bit hectic in general (I am a married man, an expat
living 8000km away from relatives and a fresh dad); so excuse me for brute
force, unhandled corner cases, poor parsing of input or false assumption here
and there. Pragmatically speaking, given the purpose and input size of most of
the puzzles brute force is often a good (or at least considerable) choice.

**Have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!**
