# Advent of Code

Repository of my solutions of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
programming riddles.

## Disclaimer
These solutions are only as good so I can call it a (solved) day. They're not
showcase of my skills nor a good learning material. **I do this for fun and
joy**. My Christmas time tends to be hectic in general (I a married man, expat
living 8000km away from relatives and fresh dad to one month old); so excuse me
for brute force, unhandled corner case or false assumption here and there...

**Have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!**
