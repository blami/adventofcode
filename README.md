# Advent of Code

Repository of my solutions of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
programming riddles.

## Disclaimer
These solutions are only as good so I can call it a (solved) day. They're not a
showcase of my skills or good learning material. **I do this for fun and joy**.
My Christmas time tends to be hectic in general (I am a married man, expat
living 8000km away from relatives and fresh dad); so excuse me for brute force,
unhandled corner case, or false assumption here and there. Pragmatically
speaking, given the purpose and input size of most of the riddles brute force
is often a good choice.

**Have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!**
