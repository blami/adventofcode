# Advent of Code

Repository of my hot-sewed solutions of [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming tasks in Go.

Note that **I do this for fun and joy** and not as a showcase of my programming
skill. Aside from fact Christmas tend to be hectic time in general I live alone
with my wife 8000 km away from our relatives (EDIT: now we also have 1 month
old baby) and work in IT 8 hours every day so I have better things to do than
writing unit tests or picking the weirdest but most performant algorithm to
solve particular task.

Have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
