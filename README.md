# Advent of Code

Repository of my solutions of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
programming tasks.

Note that **I do this for fun and joy** and not as a showcase of my programming
skill. Aside from the fact that Christmas tend to be hectic time in general I
live alone with my wife 8000km away from our relatives (EDIT: now we also have
1 month old baby) and work as a software engineer; so I have better things to
do than writing unit tests or handling corner cases beyond "it works on my
`input.txt`".

Have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
