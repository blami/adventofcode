# Advent of Code

Repository with my solutions of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
programming puzzles.

## Usage
I restrict myself to use of Go standard library. All solutions are meant as
standalone binaries that read input from `stdin` and print usually 2 lines
(solutions of part 1 and 2) to the `stdout`.

To run any of the solutions do simply run:
`cat ./YYYY/DD/test.txt | go run ./YYYY/DD`

## Disclaimer
These solutions are only as good so I can call it a (solved) day. They are
absolutely not a showcase of my skills nor a good learning material.
**I do this for fun and joy** during my lunchbreaks as the new puzzles pop up
at 2PM JST.

Christmas tend to be a bit hectic in general (I am a married man, an expat
living 8000km away from relatives and a fresh dad); so excuse me for brute
force, unhandled corner cases, poor parsing of input or false assumption here
and there.

**Have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!**
